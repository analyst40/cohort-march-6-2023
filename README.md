# Python Data Analyst checklist

To create your Python Data Analyst checklist:

- Click the *Issues* tab

- Click the green *New issue* button in the top-right corner

- Click the green *Get started* button

- Fill in the Issue title with "[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME]", replacing the text in the brackets with your GitHub username. Then click the green *Submit new issue* button in the bottom-right corner to create a personal checklist containing your tasks for all 27 days of the curriculum.

Whenever you complete a course/article/project, go to your issue and check it off. Note: your progress is public, which is by design for group accountability.
