# Curriculum checklist

The GitHub repository for learners in the Analyst40 cohort starting March 6, 2023.

To create your curriculum checklist:

- Click the *Issues* tab

- Click the green *New issue* button in the top-right corner

- Click the green *Get started* button

- Fill in the Issue title with "[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME]'s Analyst40", replacing the text in the brackets with your GitHub username. Then click the green *Submit new issue* button in the bottom-right corner to create a personal checklist containing your tasks for all 40 days of the curriculum.

Whenever you complete a course/article/project, go to your issue and check it off. Note: your progress is public, which is by design for group accountability.
